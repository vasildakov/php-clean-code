# Non Functional Requirement

In systems engineering and requirements engineering, a non-functional requirement (NFR) is a requirement that 
specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours. 
They are contrasted with functional requirements that define specific behavior or functions. The plan for 
implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design. The plan for implementing non-functional 
requirements is detailed in the system architecture, because they are usually architecturally significant requirements.


A system may be required to present the user with a display of the number of records in a database. 
This is a functional requirement. How current this number needs to be, is a non-functional requirement. 
If the number needs to be updated in real time, the system architects must ensure that the system is capable 
of displaying the record count within an acceptably short interval of the number of records changing.

## Accessibility

## Documentation
Documentation is any communicable material that is used to describe, explain or instruct regarding some attributes of 
an object, system or procedure, such as its parts, assembly, installation, maintenance, and use.

## Interoperability

## Extensibility

## Maintainability

## Performance 

## Quality
(A) Software's functional quality reflects how well it complies with or conforms to a given design, based on functional 
requirements or specifications.

(B) Software structural quality refers to how it meets non-functional requirements that support the delivery of the 
functional requirements, such as robustness or maintainability. It has a lot more to do with the degree to which the 
software works as needed.

Many aspects of structural quality can be evaluated only statically through the analysis of the software inner 
structure, its source code (see Software metrics), at the unit level, and at the system level (sometimes referred 
to as end-to-end testing), which is in effect how its architecture adheres to sound principles of software 
architecture outlined in a paper on the topic by Object Management Group (OMG).
