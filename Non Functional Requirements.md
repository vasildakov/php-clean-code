# Non Functional Requirement

In systems engineering and requirements engineering, a non-functional requirement (NFR) is a requirement that 
specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours. 
They are contrasted with functional requirements that define specific behavior or functions. The plan for 
implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design. The plan for implementing non-functional 
requirements is detailed in the system architecture, because they are usually architecturally significant requirements.


A system may be required to present the user with a display of the number of records in a database. 
This is a functional requirement. How current this number needs to be, is a non-functional requirement. 
If the number needs to be updated in real time, the system architects must ensure that the system is capable 
of displaying the record count within an acceptably short interval of the number of records changing.
