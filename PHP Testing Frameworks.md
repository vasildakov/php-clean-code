# PHP Testing Frameworks

## PHPUnit
PHPUnit is the most commonly used PHP testing framework, and it is considered a programmer-oriented framework. 
It is mostly preferred for unit testing. It was developed by Sebastian Bergmann and is an instance of the xUnit 
framework architecture.


## Codeception
Codeception is one of the most widely used PHP testing frameworks, and it has gained immense popularity because of 
ease of use and its ability to maintain the code modules. It supports three levels of testing, namely acceptance 
testing, functional testing, and unit testing. It provides multiple modules that can be utilized for testing purposes 
in a single framework.

## Behat

Behat is a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework for PHP. It was built entirely for PHP, and it has many core 
PHP modules in it. The code is usually written in simple English language, easily understandable by all the 
stakeholders in the project. The BDD structure usually contains the Context, Action, and Outcome, and this format 
is called Gherkin. Below is a simple example of writing tests in the Gherkin language.

## Phpspec
Phpspec is another Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework that is used to write and execute tests written in PHP. 
It is well-known for driving the design according to the specifications provided by the developer.

A BDD framework contains specifications written in the English language, which helps in understanding the tests. 
It describes the behavior of the application using Gherkin language.

## Peridot

Peridot is another one of the widely used PHP testing frameworks, which is a type of BDD framework. 
Some developers even claim that it is one of the best PHP frameworks available for a BDD approach. 
The tests are written in describe-it syntax in Peridot, which makes it simpler to read, understand, 
and maintain. It is considered one of the fastest among the PHP framework as it loads and runs the 
test suites quickly and runs them concurrently.
