# Software development

Software development is the process used to **conceive**, **specify**, **design**, **program**, **document**, 
**test**, and **bug fix** in order to create and maintain applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software development involves writing 
and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all processes from the conception of the desired 
software through the final manifestation, typically in a planned and structured process often overlapping with software 
engineering. Software development also includes research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, 
re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.

# Software engineering

Software engineering is an engineering-based approach to software development. A software engineer is a person who 
applies the engineering design process to **design**, **develop**, **test**, **maintain**, and **evaluate** computer 
software. The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may emphasize software implementation over design and can 
also lack connotations of engineering education or skills.

# Software craftsmanship

Software craftsmanship is an approach to software development that emphasizes the coding skills of the software 
developers. It is a response by software developers to the perceived ills of the mainstream software industry, 
including the prioritization of financial concerns over developer accountability.

The origins of software craftsmanship came from the agile software development movement which aimed to reform software 
project management in the 1990s.

# Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship

As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and 
helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

- Not only working software, but also well-crafted software 
- Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value 
- Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals 
- Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.

# Software Engineering | Classification of Software Requirements
Main types of software requirement can be of 3 types:

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Domain requirements

**Functional Requirements**: These are the requirements that the end user specifically demands as basic facilities 
that the system should offer. It can be a calculation, data manipulation, business process, user interaction, or any 
other specific functionality which defines what function a system is likely to perform. All these functionalities need 
to be necessarily incorporated into the system as a part of the contract. These are represented or stated in the form 
of input to be given to the system, the operation performed and the output expected. They are basically the 
requirements stated by the user which one can see directly in the final product, unlike the non-functional 
requirements. For example, in a hospital management system, a doctor should be able to retrieve the information of 
his patients. Each high-level functional requirement may involve several interactions or dialogues between the 
system and the outside world. In order to accurately describe the functional requirements, all scenarios must be 
enumerated. There are many ways of expressing functional requirements e.g., natural language, a structured or 
formatted language with no rigorous syntax and formal specification language with proper syntax. Functional 
Requirements in Software Engineering are also called Functional Specification.

**Non-functional requirements**: These are basically the quality constraints that the system must satisfy according 
to the project contract.Nonfunctional requirements, not related to the system functionality, rather define how the 
system should perform The priority or extent to which these factors are implemented varies from one project to other. 
They are also called non-behavioral requirements. They basically deal with issues like:

- Portability
- Security
- Maintainability
- Reliability
- Scalability
- Performance
- Reusability
- Flexibility

**Domain requirements**: Domain requirements are the requirements which are characteristic of a particular category or 
domain of projects. Domain requirements can be functional or nonfunctional. Domain requirements engineering is a 
continuous process of proactively defining the requirements for all foreseeable applications to be developed in the 
software product line. The basic functions that a system of a specific domain must necessarily exhibit come under 
this category. For instance, in an academic software that maintains records of a school or college, the functionality 
of being able to access the list of faculty and list of students of each grade is a domain requirement. These 
requirements are therefore identified from that domain model and are not user specific.
